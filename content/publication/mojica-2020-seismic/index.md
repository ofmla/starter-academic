abstract: Generating seismic modeling software is a prime activity in exploration seismology as it plays an important role in almost all its aspects such as data acquisition, processing, interpretation, and reservoir characterization. The need to write high performance code is inevitable, even though this can eventually raise the development cost. One possible approach for shortening implementation times is the automatic code generation. This approach is gaining ever increasing popularity in software development, due to the advantages it offers. A recent and particularly noteworthy example of this is Devito, a finite-difference code-generation framework. Using a case study, we will show how Devito allows quickly building a seismic forward modeling application without having to develop everything from scratch. We used a typical Brazilian pre-salt model to generate realistic 2D and 3D acoustic synthetic datasets which are serving to test the robustness of imaging/ inversion algorithms developed by Brazilian research centers and universities.
